## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to understand how to use jupyter notebook as well as SQLite in order to extract the desired data from a data table and present it as a data table. The use of SQlites/ Anaaconda Navigator allows users to access files locally as opposed to setting up a server to access jupyter notebook files. This analysis also showed how to extract data for specific months in a data table of a whole year and run an analysis for the desired months.

## Results
Three major points that are presented from the two deliverbales are:
1. The mean temperature for June (~74.9) was higher than the mean temperature for June (~71.0)
2. There was a higher count for June as compared to December by alomost 200 (1700 vs 1517)
3. December had a higher range in temperatures (27) than June (21)
* All major points can be drawn from Images 1 and 2

## Summary
The results show that June has the higher range of temperatures as expected since June lands in the summer and December lands in the winter. When looking at the breakdown of the temperatures, December's mean temperature lands around the 50% range for temperatures whereas June's mean temperature lands inbetween the 25% and 50% range for temperatures. Since the mean for june being at a lower range could mean that there was a higher abundance of lower temperatures, but the higher temperatures tended to be near the max temperature for the month. For December, the mean being close to the 50% range could mean that the temperatures were more spread out through out the month.
Two other queries I would be interested in looking at for each month are:
1. The average percipitation for each month (to see is the amount of rainfall during each month could effect the temperature)
2. The elevation of the stations to see if there is a correlation between the elevation of a station and how more succeptible they are to higher or lower temperatures.
